ITSA_Junior_Developer_Assessment

Hey, this is Teboho Phofu's Technical Assessment.

There are a few points I'd want to make about this assessment. The SQLite database is connected to the Addendum A MVC, and the connection source is my local hard drive. The Data Folder contains the database and the SQL script that is used to populate it. To connect to the database, I utilized the SQLite/SQL Server Compact Tool.
